# Vector-Space-Model
This is a small search engine that takes a query from the user as an input and searches in 10 documents to find all documents that match as an output.
I used nltk library and applied the vector space model to retrieve documents and the cosine similarity between query and each retrieved document. 
then I showed the output using Flask and HTML pages.

## How it works?
### Files
#### main.py
create flask instance, which is then used to run the application.
#### VSM.py
contains python could to implement the vector space model
#### requirements.txt
contains all requirements to run the project
### Folders
#### Files
text files that includes test to perform on it the VSM
#### Static
contains css, js and etc.. files to run the template
#### Templates
contains html files.


## How it works?
### 1- download files 
### 2- create a virtual environment for python 
### 3- download requirements libraries from requirements.txt
### 4- choose main.py as your target script
