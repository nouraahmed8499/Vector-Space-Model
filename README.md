# Vector-Space-Model
This is a small search engine that takes a query from the user as an input and searches in 10 documents to find all documents that match as an output.
I used nltk library and applied the vector space model to retrieve documents and the cosine similarity between query and each retrieved document. 
then I showed the output using Flask and HTML pages.
